To ensure stable user ID allocations, the acct-user|group sysuser files
are used. In case a package uses its own sysuser file with a dynamic
allocation, we should add its allocated entry from
/usr/share/baselayout/passwd|group here to ensure that the ID is
stable.

systemd-coredump, system-timesync and systemd-oom were dynamically
allocated for some time, so there users/groups were possibly allocated
IDs 997, 998 and 999. So when adding new users and groups, let's stay
away from this range of IDs.
